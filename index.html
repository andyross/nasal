        <h3>Nasal: Not another scripting language!</h3>

<ul>
<li>Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)</li>
<li>"Normal" OOP syntax</li>
<li>Small! 146k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible</li>
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Garbage collected</li>
<li>Threadsafe</li>
</ul><p>Nasal is a language that I wrote for use in a personal
project. Ostensibly it was because I was frustrated with the dearth of
small-but-complete embeddable scripting languages, but of course I
really wrote it because it was fun. It is still young and incomplete
in a few places, but is under active development and has been
integrated as the extension language for the FlightGear simulator.</p>

<p>Documentation is still sparse. There is a design document available,
which talks at length about the "why's" behind the design of Nasal and
includes documentation for the built-in library functions. More useful
to the experienced programmer is the tutorial-style sample code, which
explains and demonstrates all the syntax features of the language.</p>
