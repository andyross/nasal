A quick (but surprisingly complete) Nasal apache module.  This has
been tested successfuly with httpd 2.0.54 and 2.2.3.  Usage:

1. Build with "make", assuming you have a working apache installation
   with mod_so configured, the "apxs" program on your path, and write
   access to your apache configuration.

2. Edit your httpd.conf or equivalent configuration files to add the
   following lines at the top level (or in a virtual host):

     NasalInit /usr/local/lib/nasal/driver.nas
     NasalHandler <this-directory>/ns-handler.nas ns
     NasalHandler <this-directory>/nhtm-handler.nas nhtm
     AddHandler ns .ns
     AddHandler nhtm .nhtm

3. Drop the test.ns (Nasal "servlet" handler) and test.nhtm (JSP-like
   template language) into your web tree and hit them.  Edit away.
   Try stuff.  Ask Andy for docs.

Extra steps that would probably be advised:

+ Add index.nhtm to your DirectoryIndex directive(s) along with
  index.html, index.php, etc...

+ Add a section to disallow downloading the source code of *.nas
  modules that you are using in your web tree, e.g.:
   <Files *.nas>
     Order Allow, Deny
     Deny from all
   </Files>
