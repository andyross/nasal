Nasal 0.9, 2003 Dec 03
----------------------

Bug Fixes:

Parser precedence bug with unary negation expressions like "5 * -1".
Properly handle "optimized" assignment of function argument vectors
  for nested cases like "a(b(), c())".
Fixed boundary checking in naVec_get().
GC bug on interpreter entry: the arguments to naCall() could be
  collected before being placed on the Nasal stack.
Lexer fixes to properly support "\x" escaping in double quoted strings.
Lexer fixes to properly support "_" in symbol names.

New Features:

Stack trace support added to the C error handling API.
Added a math library.
Library functions: delete(), setsize(), subvec()
Lexical function binding can happen from user code via naBindFunction().
New naSave() API for explicitly caching references to preserve
  them across garbage collection.
Vim syntax highlighting file contributed by Melchior FRANZ.
A new "ghost" opaque handle type, which wraps a C pointer and provides
  for a callback upon garbage collection.
