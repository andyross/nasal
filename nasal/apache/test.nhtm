<p>Some bare text in the document.

<p>Some Nasal code to execute: <b><% print("print() works"); %></b>

<p>Our incremented page-local variable:<b><%= local_to_page+=1 %></b>

<p><i>Note that the above variable is local to a specific httpd
process.  If you are using the default prefork MPM, you will see a
separate count for each process; hit reload a few times to see the
count increment.  You can use the threaded MPM to share data across
many requests if you like, but don't; there are synchronization
primitives in mod_nasal.c yet.</i>

<p>A loop:
<% foreach(a; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) { %>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loop iteration: <b><%= a %></b><br>
<% } %>

<p>Some initialization code, which will run *before* the page is executed:
<%! var local_to_page = 123456789; %>
<p>(No, you don't see anything.  That's the point.  The code ran
   during page complication time!).
