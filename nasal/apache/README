A quick (but surprisingly complete) Nasal apache module.  This has
been tested successfuly with httpd 2.0.54 and 2.2.3.  Usage:

1. Build with "make", assuming you have a working apache installation
   with mod_so configured, the "apxs" program on your path, and write
   access to your apache configuration.

2. Edit your httpd.conf or equivalent configuration files to add the
   following lines at the top level (or in a virtual host):

     NasalInit /usr/local/lib/nasal/driver.nas
     NasalHandler <this-directory>/ns-handler.nas ns
     NasalHandler <this-directory>/nhtm-handler.nas nhtm
     AddHandler ns .ns
     AddHandler nhtm .nhtm

3. Drop the test.ns (Nasal "servlet" handler) and test.nhtm (JSP-like
   template language) into your web tree and hit them.  Edit away.
   Try stuff.  Ask Andy for docs.
