Common CGI environment variables which can be queried with the
getcgi() function.  Note that fields marked with an asterisk (*) are
Apache-specific extensions, and not part of the CGI 1.1 specification.

  REQUEST_METHOD   HTTP method ("GET", "POST", etc...)

 *SERVER_ADDR      local IP address on which the connection was accepted
  SERVER_PORT      local TCP port (e.g. "80")
  REMOTE_ADDR      client IP address
  REMOTE_PORT      client TCP port

 *REQUEST_URI      full url synthesized from:
  SERVER_NAME      "Host" header from the request (not the real hostname!)
  SCRIPT_NAME      url prefix specifying this file (*not* incl. trailing "/")
  PATH_INFO        url suffix after SCRIPT_NAME (*including* leading "/")
  QUERY_STRING     text after (*not* including) the first "?" in the url

  SERVER_PROTOCOL    HTTP protocol version (e.g. "HTTP/1.1")
  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI version (e.g. "CGI/1.1")

 *SERVER_ADMIN       email address of server admin, usually wrong
 *SERVER_SIGNATURE   ?
 *SERVER_SOFTWARE    Server version (e.g. "Apache/2.2.3 (Unix) ...")

 *DOCUMENT_ROOT      real directory containing web tree
 *SCRIPT_FILENAME    location of this file (in the real filesystem)


And when running under SSL/TLS, a whole slew of other variables are
set.  Most of these are not useful to application authors; it should
generally suffice to check that "HTTPS" is set to "on" and (if
desired, for maximum security) that the SSL_PROTOCOL is "TLSv1".

  HTTPS                 (e.g. "on")
  SSL_VERSION_INTERFACE (e.g. "mod_ssl/2.2.3")
  SSL_VERSION_LIBRARY   (e.g. "OpenSSL/0.9.8a")
  SSL_PROTOCOL          (e.g. "TLSv1")
  SSL_COMPRESS_METHOD   (e.g. "NULL")
  SSL_CIPHER            (e.g. "DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA")
  SSL_CIPHER_EXPORT     (e.g. "false")
  SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE (e.g. "256")
  SSL_CIPHER_ALGKEYSIZE (e.g. "256")
  SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY     (e.g. "NONE")
  SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION  (e.g. "3")
  SSL_SERVER_M_SERIAL   (e.g. "D83844DDFB32A6F6")
  SSL_SERVER_V_START    (e.g. "Oct 26 17:42:26 2006 GMT")
  SSL_SERVER_V_END      (e.g. "Oct 26 17:42:26 2016 GMT")
  SSL_SERVER_A_KEY      (e.g. "rsaEncryption")
  SSL_SERVER_A_SIG      (e.g. "sha1WithRSAEncryption")

  SSL_SERVER_x_DN       Distinguishing name (x: S or I)
  SSL_SERVER_x_DN_y     Parsed field from DN x (y: C/ST/L/O/OU/CN)
