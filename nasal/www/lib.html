<h3>Data Structure Basics</h3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>append(vector, elements...)
<dd>The first argument specifies a vector.  Appends the remaining
    arguments to the end of the vector.

<dt>setsize(vector, size)
<dd>Sets the size of a vector. The first argument specifies a vector,
    the second a number representing the desired size of that vector.
    If the vector is currently larger than the specified size, it is
    truncated.  If it is smaller, it is padded with nil entries.
    Returns the vector operated upon.

<dt>subvec(vector, start, length=nil)
<dd>Returns a sub-range of a vector.  The first argument specifies a
    vector, the second a starting index, and the optional third
    argument indicates a length (the default is to the end of the
    vector).

<dt>contains(hash, key)
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar.  Returns 1 if the hash contains the scalar as a key, 0
    if not.

<dt>delete(hash, key)
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar key.  Deletes the key from the hash if it exists.
    Operationally, this is identical to setting the hash value specified
    by the key to nil, but this variant potentially frees
    storage by deleting the reference to the key and by shrinking
    the hash.

<dt>int(value)
<dd>Returns the integer part of the numeric value of the single
    argument, or nil if none exists.

<dt>num(value)
<dd>Returns the numeric value of the single argument, or nil if none
    exists.

<dt>keys(hash)
<dd>Returns a vector containing the list of keys found in the single
    hash argument.

<dt>pop(vector)
<dd>Removes and returns the last element of the single vector argument.

<dt>size(object)
<dd>Returns the size of the single argument.  For strings, this is
    the length in bytes.  For vectors, this is the number of
    elements.  For hashes, it is the number of key/value pairs.  Returns
    nil for number and nil arguments.

<dt>streq(a, b)
<dd>Tests the string values of the two arguments for equality.  Needed
    because the == operator in Nasal tests for numeric equality, as in
    perl.  So <code>"0"&nbsp;==&nbsp"0.0"</code> is true,
    but <code>streq("0",&nbsp;"0.0")</code> is false.  This is rarely
    required in typical code.

<dt>cmp(a, b)
<dd>Compares two strings, returning -1 if a is less than b, 0 if they
    are identical, and 1 if a is greater than b.

<dt>substr(string, start, length=nil)
<dd>Computes a substring.  The first argument specifes a string, the
    second is an integer index of the start of a substring, the
    optional third argument specifies a length (the default is to
    return the remaining string).  Example: substr("abcde", 1, 3)
    returns "bcd".

<dt>sprintf(format, varargs...)
<dd>Creates and returns a string formatted as per ANSI C sprintf().

<dt>find(needle, haystack)
<dd>Finds and returns the index of the first occurence of the string
    needle in the string haystack, or -1 if no such occurence was found.

<dt>split(delimeter, string)
<dd>Splits the input string into a vector of substrings bounded by
    occurences of the delimeter substring.

<dt>rand(seed=nil)
<dd>Returns a random number in the range [0:1) (that is, 0.0 is a
  possible return value.  1.0 is not).  If a numeric argument is
  specified, it is used as a seed instead and the function returns
  nil.  Implemented in terms of the C library's rand/srand functions;
  the result should have a full double-precision number's worth of
  randomness even on systems with a 15 bit rand().

</dl><h3>Internals and Functional Programming</h3><dl>

<dt>typeof(thing)
<dd>Returns a string indicating the type of the single argument, any
    of: nil, scalar, vector, hash, func, or ghost.

<dt>die(error)
<dd>Terminates execution and unwinds the stack.  This invokes the same
    internal exception handler used for internal runtime errors. Use
    this to signal fatal errors, or to implement exception handling.
    The error thrown (including internal runtime errors) can be caught
    with call().

<dt>call(fn, args=[], me=nil, namespace=nil, error=nil)
<dd>Calls the given function with the given arguments and returns the
    result.  The optional arguments can be used to specify the "me"
    reference for a function call and the local variable namespace.  The
    error argument, if present, must be a vector.  If the called
    function terminates due to a runtime error or die() call, the error
    (either a string or the argument to die() is appended to the vector,
    followed by the file name at which the error occurred, followed by
    the line number in that file, followed in order by each file/line
    number on the call stack.

<dt>caller(level=1)
<dd>Returns a record from the current call stack.  Level zero is the
    currently executing function.  Level one (the default) is the caller
    of the current function, etc... The result is a four element vector
    containing: the local variables hash table, the function object, the
    source file, and the line number.

<dt>compile(code, filename="&lt;compile&gt;")
<dd>Compiles the specified code string and returns a function object
    bound to the current lexical context.  The file name of the
    function, if unspecified in the second argument, is simply
    "&lt;compile&gt;".

<dt>closure(fn, level=0)
<dd>Returns the hash table representing the lexical namespace of the
    given function.  Level zero is the scope in which the func{...}
    expression was evaluated.  Level one is the enclosing scope, etc...

<dt>bind(func, namespace=nil, outer_scope=nil)
<dd>Creates a new function argument from the code (but *not* lexical
    context) of the function argument, the specified namespace hash
    table, and the specified outer scope (which is itself a function
    argument).  The result is a function object that looks as if the
    original func{...} expression had been evaluated inside a function
    whose local variables are the namespace hash, inside the func{...}
    code block defined by the outer_scope argument.

</dl><h3>Math Library</h3><dl>

<dt>math.sin(number)
<dd>Returns the sine of the single argument

<dt>math.cos(number)
<dd>Returns the cosine of the single argument

<dt>math.exp(number)
<dd>Returns <i>e</i> (Euler's constant) raised to the power
    specified by the single argument

<dt>math.ln(number)
<dd>Returns the natural logarithm of the single argument.

<dt>math.sqrt(number)
<dd>Returns the square root of the single argument.

<dt>math.atan2(x, y)
<dd>Returns the arctangent of y/x, with the correct sign for the
    quadrant.  Wraps the ANSI C function of the same name.

<dt>math.e
<dd>Euler's constant: 2.7182818284590452354

<dt>math.pi
<dd>Pi: 3.14159265358979323846

</dl><h3>Bitfield Library</h3><dl>

<dt>bits.fld(string, startbit, length)
<dd>Interpreting the string str as bits, returns the bitfield of the
    specified length starting at startbit.  Interprets the result as
    an unsigned integer.

<dt>bits.sfld(string, startbit, length)
<dd>As bits.fld(), but interprets the result as a 2's complement
    signed value.

<dt>bits.setfld(string, startbit, length, value)
<dd>Sets the specified value into the bit string at the specified
    position.  The string must be mutable: either the result of a
    runtime concatenation (the ~ operator) or a call to bits.buf()
    (see below).  Attempts to modify immutable strings (e.g. compile
    time constants) will produce a runtime error.

<dt>bits.buf(length)
<dd>Returns a zero-filled mutable string of the specified length.

</dl><h3>I/O Library</h3><dl>

<dt>io.open(filename, mode="r")
<dd>Opens the file with the specified mode (as per ANSI fopen()) and
    returns a ghost object representing the filehandle.  Failures are
    thrown as runtime errors as per die().

<dt>io.close(filehandle)
<dd>Closes the specified file as per ANSI fclose().

<dt>io.read(filehandle, buf, len)
<dd>Attempts to read length bytes from the filehandle into the
    beginning of the mutable string buf.  Failures (including overruns
    when length &gt; size(buf)) are thrown as runtime errors as per
    die().  Returns the number of bytes successfully read.

<dt>io.write(filehandle, str)
<dd>Attempts to write the entirety of the specified string to the
    filehandle.  Failures are thrown as runtime errors as per die().
    Returns the number of bytes successfully written.

<dt>io.seek(filehandle, position, whence)
<dd>As ANSI fseek().  Attempts to seek to the specified position based
    on the whence value (which must be one of io.SEEK_SET,
    io.SEEK_END, or io.SEEK_CUR).

<dt>io.tell(filehandle)
<dd>Returns the current seek position of the filehandle.

<dt>io.readln(filehandle)
<dd>Reads and returns a single text line from the filehandle.
   Interprets both "\n" and "\r\n" as end of line markers, and does
   not include the "\r" or "\n" bytes in the returned string.  End of
   file or error is signaled by returning nil.

<dt>io.stat(filename)
<dd>Calls unix or win32 stat() on the specified file name and returns
    a seven element array whose contents are, in order: dev, ino, mode,
    nlink, uid, gid, rdef, size, atime, mtime, ctime.  Errors are
    signaled as exceptions as per die().

</dl><h3>Unix Library</h3><dl>

<dt>unix.pipe()
<dd>Creates a pipe and returns a 2-element array containing the read
    and write filehandles.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.fork()
<dd>Forks the process as per the system call of the same name.
    Runtime errors are signaled as exceptions of the same name.

<dt>unix.dup2(oldfilehandle, newfilehandle)
<dd>Makes newfilehandle a copy of oldfilehandle as per the system call
    of the same name.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.exec(filename, argv, envp)
<dd>Calls unix execve() to replace this process with a new one.  The
    argv and env arrays are passed to the new process.  Runtime errors
    are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.waitpid(pid, nohang=0)
<dd>Calls unix waitpid() to retrieve the exit code of a child
    process.  The nohang flag causes WNOHANG to be passed to the
    system call.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.opendir(directorypath)
<dd>Opens the specified directory and returns a ghost handle.  Runtime
    errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.readdir(dirhandle)
<dd>Reads and returns the next filename from the directory handle.
    Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.closedir(dirhandle)
<dd>Closes the specified directory handle.

<dt>unix.time()
<dd>Returns the current system time, in fractional epoch seconds.
    Uses gettimeofday() to achieve millisecond or better resolution.

<dt>unix.chdir(path)
<dd>Changes the current working directory.  Runtime errors are
     signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.environ()
<dd>Returns the current unix environment as an array of strings of the
    form "VAR=value".

</dl><h3>Regex (PCRE) Library</h3><dl>

<dt>regex.compile(regex, opts="")
<dd>Calls pcre_compile()/pcre_study() and returns a ghost representing
    the compiled regular expression object.  The opts string
    (corresponding to the "letters after the slash" in a perl regex)
    can contain the bytes: 'i' for caseless matching, 'm' for
    multiline behavior where '^$' can match next to a newline, 's' for
    single line behavior where the dot matches newlines, and 'x' for
    extended syntax allowing whitespace and comments.

<dt>regex.exec(regex, string, start=0)
<dd>Matches the regular expression against the string starting at the
    specified index.  Returns a vector (the pcre "ovector") containing
    matches.  Each match returned is stored as a start and
    one-past-end offset in the vector.  An empty vector indicates no
    match.  The first match is the entirety of the matched substring.
    Matches 1 and higher contain the parenthesized submatches, if any,
    in the order in which their opening parenthesis appears in the
    regular expression.
