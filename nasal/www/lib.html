<h3>Data Structure Basics</h3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>append(vector, elements...)
<dd>The first argument specifies a vector.  Appends the remaining
    arguments to the end of the vector.

<dt>setsize(vector, size)
<dd>Sets the size of a vector. The first argument specifies a vector,
    the second a number representing the desired size of that vector.
    If the vector is currently larger than the specified size, it is
    truncated.  If it is smaller, it is padded with nil entries.
    Returns the vector operated upon.

<dt>subvec(vector, start, length=nil)
<dd>Returns a sub-range of a vector.  The first argument specifies a
    vector, the second a starting index, and the optional third
    argument indicates a length (the default is to the end of the
    vector).

<dt>contains(hash, key)
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar.  Returns 1 if the hash contains the scalar as a key, 0
    if not.

<dt>delete(hash, key)
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar key.  Deletes the key from the hash if it exists.
    Operationally, this is identical to setting the hash value specified
    by the key to nil, but this variant potentially frees
    storage by deleting the reference to the key and by shrinking
    the hash.

<dt>int(value)
<dd>Returns the integer part of the numeric value of the single
    argument, or nil if none exists.  Truncates towards zero, not
    negative infinity (i.e. it's implemented in C as a double to
    integer typecast).

<dt>num(value)
<dd>Returns the numeric value of the single argument, or nil if none
    exists.

<dt>keys(hash)
<dd>Returns a vector containing the list of keys found in the single
    hash argument.

<dt>pop(vector)
<dd>Removes and returns the last element of the single vector argument.

<dt>size(object)
<dd>Returns the size of the single argument.  For strings, this is
    the length in bytes.  For vectors, this is the number of
    elements.  For hashes, it is the number of key/value pairs.  Returns
    nil for number and nil arguments.

<dt>streq(a, b)
<dd>Tests the string values of the two arguments for equality.  Needed
    because the == operator in Nasal tests for numeric equality, as in
    perl.  So <code>"0"&nbsp;==&nbsp"0.0"</code> is true,
    but <code>streq("0",&nbsp;"0.0")</code> is false.  This is rarely
    required in typical code.

<dt>cmp(a, b)
<dd>Compares two strings, returning -1 if a is less than b, 0 if they
    are identical, and 1 if a is greater than b.

<dt>sort(vector, function)
<dd>Creates a new vector containing the elements in the input vector
    sorted in ascending order according to the rule given
    by <code>function</code>, which takes two arguments (elements of
    the input vector) and should return less than zero, zero, or
    greater than zero if the first argument is, respectively, less
    than, equal to, or greater than the second argument.  Despite
    being implemented with ANSI C <code>qsort()</code>, the sort is
    stable; "equal" elements in the output vector will appear in the
    same relative order as they do in the input.

<dt>substr(string, start, length=nil)
<dd>Computes a substring.  The first argument specifes a string, the
    second is an integer index of the start of a substring, the
    optional third argument specifies a length (the default is to
    return the remaining string).  Example: substr("abcde", 1, 3)
    returns "bcd".

<dt>sprintf(format, varargs...)
<dd>Creates and returns a string formatted as per ANSI C sprintf().

<dt>find(needle, haystack)
<dd>Finds and returns the index of the first occurence of the string
    needle in the string haystack, or -1 if no such occurence was found.

<dt>split(delimeter, string)
<dd>Splits the input string into a vector of substrings bounded by
    occurences of the delimeter substring.

<dt>rand(seed=nil)
<dd>Returns a random number in the range [0:1) (that is, 0.0 is a
  possible return value.  1.0 is not).  If a numeric argument is
  specified, it is used as a seed instead and the function returns
  nil.  Implemented in terms of the C library's rand/srand functions;
  the result should have a full double-precision number's worth of
  randomness even on systems with a 15 bit rand().

</dl><h3>Internals and Functional Programming</h3><dl>

<dt>typeof(thing)
<dd>Returns a string indicating the type of the single argument, any
    of: nil, scalar, vector, hash, func, or ghost.

<dt>die(error)
<dd>Terminates execution and unwinds the stack.  This invokes the same
    internal exception handler used for internal runtime errors. Use
    this to signal fatal errors, or to implement exception handling.
    The error thrown (including internal runtime errors) can be caught
    with call().

<dt>call(fn, args=[], me=nil, namespace=nil, error=nil)
<dd>Calls the given function with the given arguments and returns the
    result.  The optional arguments can be used to specify the "me"
    reference for a function call and the local variable namespace.  The
    error argument, if present, must be a vector.  If the called
    function terminates due to a runtime error or die() call, the error
    (either a string or the argument to die() is appended to the vector,
    followed by the file name at which the error occurred, followed by
    the line number in that file, followed in order by each file/line
    number on the call stack.

<dt>caller(level=1)
<dd>Returns a record from the current call stack.  Level zero is the
    currently executing function.  Level one (the default) is the caller
    of the current function, etc... The result is a four element vector
    containing: the local variables hash table, the function object, the
    source file, and the line number.

<dt>compile(code, filename="&lt;compile&gt;")
<dd>Compiles the specified code string and returns a function object
    bound to the current lexical context.  The file name of the
    function, if unspecified in the second argument, is simply
    "&lt;compile&gt;".  On error, the function dies with a
    user-readable string error message as per die().

<dt>closure(fn, level=0)
<dd>Returns the hash table representing the lexical namespace of the
    given function.  Level zero is the scope in which the func{...}
    expression was evaluated.  Level one is the enclosing scope, etc...

<dt>bind(func, namespace=nil, outer_scope=nil)
<dd>The opposite of closure, bind() creates a new function object.  A
    function in Nasal is three things: the first is the actual
    bytecode or C function pointer of the function (specified here via
    another function argument from which to extract the code).  The
    second is the local variable namespace (a hash table) of the
    "super-function" that was running when the function was bound
    (i.e., when the func{...} expression was evaluated).  The third is
    the closure object of that super-function from which the lexical
    environment of the super-super-function can be extracted, etc...

</dl><h3>Math Library</h3><dl>

    specified by the single argument

<dt>math.ln(number)
<dd>Returns the natural logarithm of the single argument.

<dt>math.sqrt(number)
<dd>Returns the square root of the single argument.

<dt>math.atan2(x, y)

<dt>math.pi
<dd>Pi: 3.14159265358979323846

</dl><h3>Bitfield Library</h3><dl>

<dt>bits.fld(string, startbit, length)
<dd>Interpreting the string str as bits, returns the bitfield of the
    specified length starting at startbit.  Interprets the result as
    an unsigned integer.

<dt>bits.sfld(string, startbit, length)
<dd>As bits.fld(), but interprets the result as a 2's complement
    signed value.

<dt>bits.setfld(string, startbit, length, value)
<dd>Sets the specified value into the bit string at the specified
    position.  The string must be mutable: either the result of a
    runtime concatenation (the ~ operator) or a call to bits.buf()
    (see below).  Attempts to modify immutable strings (e.g. compile
    time constants) will produce a runtime error.

<dt>bits.buf(length)
<dd>Returns a zero-filled mutable string of the specified length.

</dl><h3>UTF8 Library</h3><dl>

<dt>utf8.chstr(unicode)
<dd>Returns a string containing the UTF8 representation of the
    specified unicode character value.
    
<dt>utf8.strc(string, index)
<dd>Returns the unicode character at the specified index within the UTF8
    string.  Dies on encoding error or overrun.

<dt>utf8.substr(string, start, len=nil)
<dd>As for regular substr(), but the indices are of UTF8 characters
    intead of bytes.  Dies on encoding error or overflow.

<dt>utf8.size(string)
<dd>As for regular size() when called on a string, but returns the
    number of UTF8 unicode characters instead of bytes.  Dies on
    encoding error.

<dt>utf8.validate(string, replace=`?`)
<dd>Checks the string for UTF8 validity.  At every byte position where
    an encoding error is found, it replaces that byte with the
    specified replacement character (default is `?`).  Note that the
    second argument is a number, not a string.

</dl><h3>I/O Library</h3><dl>

<dt>io.open(filename, mode="r")
<dd>Opens the file with the specified mode (as per ANSI fopen()) and
    returns a ghost object representing the filehandle.  Failures are
    thrown as runtime errors as per die().

<dt>io.close(filehandle)
<dd>Closes the specified file as per ANSI fclose().

<dt>io.read(filehandle, buf, len)
<dd>Attempts to read length bytes from the filehandle into the
    beginning of the mutable string buf.  Failures (including overruns
    when length &gt; size(buf)) are thrown as runtime errors as per
    die().  Returns the number of bytes successfully read.

<dt>io.write(filehandle, str)
<dd>Attempts to write the entirety of the specified string to the
    filehandle.  Failures are thrown as runtime errors as per die().
    Returns the number of bytes successfully written.

<dt>io.seek(filehandle, position, whence)
<dd>As ANSI fseek().  Attempts to seek to the specified position based
    on the whence value (which must be one of io.SEEK_SET,
    io.SEEK_END, or io.SEEK_CUR).

<dt>io.tell(filehandle)
<dd>Returns the current seek position of the filehandle.

<dt>io.readln(filehandle)
<dd>Reads and returns a single text line from the filehandle.
   Interprets both "\n" and "\r\n" as end of line markers, and does
   not include the "\r" or "\n" bytes in the returned string.  End of
   file or error is signaled by returning nil.

<dt>io.stat(filename)
<dd>Calls unix or win32 stat() on the specified file name and returns
    a seven element array whose contents are, in order: dev, ino, mode,
    nlink, uid, gid, rdef, size, atime, mtime, ctime.  Errors are
    signaled as exceptions as per die().

</dl><h3>Thread & Synchronization Library</h3><dl>

<p>Nasal's threadsafety implementation uses an internal, minimal
synchronization library.  The <code>thread</code> module exposes those
primitives to script code.

<dt>thread.newthread(func)
<dd>Spawns a new thread that begins running in the specified function closure.

<dt>thread.newlock()
<dd>Creates and returns a new mutex lock.

<dt>thread.lock(lock)
<dd>Locks a mutex.

<dt>thread.unlock(lock)
<dd>Unlocks a mutex.

<dt>thread.newsem()
<dd>Creates and returns a new semaphore object.

<dt>thread.semdown(sem)
<dd>Executes a "down" operation on the semaphore, waiting until a
    separate thread calls semup() if needed.

<dt>thread.semup(sem)
<dd>Executes an "up" operation on the semaphore, increasing the
    internal count and waking up one waiting thread if needed.

</dl><h3>Unix Library</h3><dl>

<dt>unix.pipe()
<dd>Creates a pipe and returns a 2-element array containing the read
    and write filehandles.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.fork()
<dd>Forks the process as per the system call of the same name.
    Runtime errors are signaled as exceptions of the same name.

<dt>unix.dup2(oldfilehandle, newfilehandle)
<dd>Makes newfilehandle a copy of oldfilehandle as per the system call
    of the same name.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.exec(filename, argv, envp)
<dd>Calls unix execve() to replace this process with a new one.  The
    argv and env arrays are passed to the new process.  Runtime errors
    are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.waitpid(pid, nohang=0)
<dd>Calls unix waitpid() to retrieve the exit code of a child
    process.  The nohang flag causes WNOHANG to be passed to the
    system call.  Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.opendir(directorypath)
<dd>Opens the specified directory and returns a ghost handle.  Runtime
    errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.readdir(dirhandle)
<dd>Reads and returns the next filename from the directory handle.
    Runtime errors are signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.closedir(dirhandle)
<dd>Closes the specified directory handle.

<dt>unix.time()
<dd>Returns the current system time, in fractional epoch seconds.
    Uses gettimeofday() to achieve millisecond or better resolution.

<dt>unix.chdir(path)
<dd>Changes the current working directory.  Runtime errors are
     signaled as per die().

<dt>unix.environ()
<dd>Returns the current unix environment as an array of strings of the
    form "VAR=value".

</dl><h3>Regex (PCRE) Library</h3><dl>

<dt>regex.comp(regex, opts="")
<dd>Calls pcre_compile()/pcre_study() and returns a ghost representing
    the compiled regular expression object.  The opts string
    (corresponding to the "letters after the slash" in a perl regex)
    can contain the bytes: 'i' for caseless matching, 'm' for
    multiline behavior where '^$' can match next to a newline, 's' for
    single line behavior where the dot matches newlines, and 'x' for
    extended syntax allowing whitespace and comments.

<dt>regex.exec(regex, string, start=0)
<dd>Matches the regular expression against the string starting at the
    specified index.  Returns a vector (the pcre "ovector") containing
    matches.  Each match returned is stored as a start and
    one-past-end offset in the vector.  An empty vector indicates no
    match.  The first match is the entirety of the matched substring.
    Matches 1 and higher contain the parenthesized submatches, if any,
    in the order in which their opening parenthesis appears in the
    regular expression.

</dl><h3>SQLite Library</h3><dl>
<p>Integration with the SQLite
    (<a href=http://www.sqlite.org>www.sqlite.org</a>) database
    engine.

<dt>sqlite.open(filename)
<dd>Opens a connection to a SQLite database in the specified file,
    creating the file if needed, and returns a db handle.  Signals
    errors via die().

<dt>sqlite.close(db)
<dd>Closes the specified database connection.  This call is generally
    optional; garbage collection will destroy stale connections.


<dt>sqlite.prepare(db, sql)
<dd>Creates a prepared statement on the specified database from the
    SQL code in the second argument.  Signals errors via die().


<dt>sqlite.exec(db, stmt, [opt. callback], bind_args...)
<dd>Executes a SQL statement (either a string or a prepared statement
    returned from prepare()).  The bind arguments are assigned in
    order to the "?" placeholders in the original SQL.  Each row of
    the result, if any, is placed in a hash table indexed by field
    name.  If the optional callback argument is specified, it is
    invoked once for each row, with the hash table as an argument.
    Otherwise, all rows returned are appended to a single vector and
    returned as the result of sqlite.exec().  Signals errors via die().

<dt>sqlite.finalize(stmt)
<dd>Finalizes and free storage associated with a prepared statement.
    This call is generally optional; garbage collection will destroy
    stale statements.

</dl><h3>GNU Readline Library</h3><dl>
<p>Minimal but functional integration with GNU readline, allowing for
runtime command line editing.  This is used by
the <code>interactive</code> module to implement the interactive nasal
interpreter.
<dt>readline(prompt="> ")
<dd>Read and return a line of input from the user, or nil at end-of-stream.

</dl>
