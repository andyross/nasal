<h2>Executive summary:</h2>

 <li>Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)

 <li>Small!  146k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible
 <li>Functional programming
 <li>Garbage collected
 <li>Threadsafe
</ul>

<p>Nasal is a language that I wrote for use in a personal project.
Ostensibly it was because I was frustrated with the dearth of
small-but-complete embeddable scripting languages, but of course I
really wrote it because it was fun.  It is still young and incomplete
in a few places, but is under active development and has been
integrated as the extension language for the <a
href="http://www.flightgear.org">FlightGear</a> simulator.
<p>
Documentation is still sparse.  There is a <a href="doc.html">design
document</a> available, which talks at length about the "why's" behind
the design of Nasal and includes documentation for the built-in
library functions.  More useful to the experienced programmer is the
tutorial-style <a href="sample.nas">sample code</a>, which explains
and demonstrates all the syntax features of the language.

<h2>Getting Nasal</h2>

<p>
The most source code recent release
is <a href="nasal-1.0.1.tar.gz">Nasal 1.0.1</a> and can be downloaded
here.
<p>
The CVS development tree is also available on plausible.org via
anonymous pserver access.  Check out using:

<pre>cvs -d :pserver:cvs@plausible.org:/home/nasal-cvs co nasal</pre>

Checkins to the archive are logged to the
<a href="http://plausible.org/pipermail/nasal-cvs/">nasal-cvs@plausible.org</a>
mailing list.

There is also a
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/cvsweb.html">cvsweb</a> interface
available at:
<a href="http://plausible.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi">http://plausible.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi</a>
for online browsing.
<p>
Those interested in the development version should consider
subscribing to the <a href="/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nasal">Nasal
mailing list</a>.  Nasal's documentation is still very limited, and
this is the best forum for getting help and making suggestions.

<h2>News and Updates</h2>

<h3>05 Jul 2006</h3>

<p>A <a href="/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nasal">mailing list</a> is now
  available for Nasal discussions.  I have fielded enough similar
  questions and suggestions from different authors that a public forum
  seems to be a good idea.  Traffic is likely to be very low, but
  hopefully having the archives available will be a cheap way to to
  improve the state of Nasal documentation.

<h3>04 Jul 2006</h3>

<p>Oops.  Nasal 1.0, which fixed a long standing bug with
break/continue inside foreach/forindex and a continue issue when used
with multi-level labels, introduced a nasty regression with the
regular old break statement.  A mark stack underflow would result and
cause a runtime error when used in large or deep loops.  A
new <a href="nasal-1.0.1.tar.gz">1.0.1 release</a> is available with a
fix for this problem.

<h3>03 Jul 2006</h3>

<p>I finally bothered to put together a new release, containing the
  updates that have been available in SimGear for some time now.
  <a href="nasal-1.0.tar.gz">Nasal 1.0 is now available for
  download</a>.  Important new functionality includes bugfixes, many
  performance enhancements, declared function argument syntax, a
  ternary (?:) operator, indexable and mutable string objects,
  interpreter threadsafety features, and much work to the "standard"
  library (including stdio, bitfields, unix system calls and PCRE
  regular expresions).

<h3>07 Dec 2004</h3>

<p><a href="nasal-0.9.2.tar.gz">Nasal 0.9.2</a> has been released.
This version adds support for multiple context objects, and uses the
new feature to implement <code>call()</code> and <code>eval()</code>
library routines.

<h3>25 Jun 2004</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://plausible.org/nasal/nasal-0.9.1.tar.gz">new
release</a>, 0.9.1 is available.  This fixes minor bugs, and changes the C
extension API to allow the called function to tell whether it was
called as an object method.  Download load it from
<a href="http://plausible.org/nasal/nasal-0.9.1.tar.gz">
http://plausible.org/nasal/nasal-0.9.1.tar.gz</a>.

<h3>27 Feb 2004</h3>

<p>Manabu Nishiyama is working on a SWIG module to generate Nasal
extension code.  Check it out at
<a href="http://balder.prohosting.com/~alteisen/swignasal/index.html">

<h3>15 Feb 2004</h3>

<p>Updated <a href="nasal.vim">nasal.vim</a> syntax highlighting file from Melchior FRANZ.

<h3>04 Dec 2003</h3>

<p>Nasal has its first customer!  The <a
href="http://www.flightgear.org">FlightGear</a> project is now using
Nasal as its embedded scripting language.  Nasal itself is now
available as part of the <a href="http://www.simgear.org">SimGear</a>
package which provides utility code for the core simulator.
Development is progressing rapidly, and SimGear is likely to be the
best place to find cutting edge Nasal code in the near-term future.
This site will continue to provide packaged code only occasionally.
Check out FlightGear, even if you aren't interested in flight
simulation.  The Nasal integration there is large and elaborate, and
makes an excellent case study for the Nasal extension API.  It
includes a large <a href="flightgear.html">FlightGear/Nasal
integration document</a>, as well.

<p><i>(Conversely, check out FlightGear even if you aren't interested
in Nasal! It's a great project.)</i>

<p>I've packaged up a <a href="nasal-0.9.tar.gz">0.9 release</a> to
match the current version in FlightGear.  It contains lots of bug
fixes; significant new features like a math library, stack trace
support for error handling, and a "ghost" mechanism for wrapping
pointers to C objects in a garbage-collector-friendly way; and some
fun toys like a <a href="nasal.vim">Vim syntax highlighting</a> file
(contributed by Melchior FRANZ) to go with the <a
href="nasal-mode.el">Emacs mode</a> I hacked together.  See the
<a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> file for more complete information.

<h3>29 Nov 2003</h3>

<p>The new 2.0-13 version of <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/highlight/">Highlight</a>, Andr√©
Simons's multi-language, multi-format, multi-theme code formatter and
pretty printer supports Nasal!

<h3>23 Sep 2003</h3>

Another <a href="nasal-0.2.2.tar.gz">release</a> is available for
public consumption.  This fixes several bugs, including crashing
issues with the garbage collector and bytecode interpreter.

<p>Also note that the name has been officially (if unimaginatively)
changed from "Nasl" to "Nasal" to avoid collision with the nice folks
at Nessus.  I'm still open to better names.  I picked this one because
it allowed me to avoid changing the pronunciation or naXXX C symbol
prefix.

<h3>18 Feb 2003</h3>
It has been brought to my attention that I have stepped on someone
else's name.  The <a href="http://www.nessus.org/">Nessus Project</a>
has already christened their extension language "NASL".  Oops.
Unfortunately, I currently lack the time or creativity to come up with
something better.  This will stay "Nasl" for now (different
capitalization, different acronymoid), but I promise to come up with
something less ambiguous before the next major release, if there is
one.  Suggestions are welcome.
<p>
There is a new <a href="nasl-0.2.1.tar.gz">package file</a>, with some
garbage collection performance/determinism improvements and two new
sample scripts to test/benchmark <a href="gcperf.nas">garbage
collection overhead</a> and <a href="objperf.nas">object access
speed</a>.  Both are acceptable and within design goals: GC is about
twice as fast as perl, object access about twice as slow.
