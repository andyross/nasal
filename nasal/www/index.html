<h1>Nasal: Not another scripting language!</h1>

<h2>Executive summary:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)</li>
 <li>"Normal" OOP syntax</li>
 <li>Small!  100k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible</li>
 <li>Functional programming</li>
 <li>Garbage collection</li>
 <li>Threadsafe</li>
</ul>

Nasal is a language that I wrote for use in a personal project.  It is
still immature, incomplete in places and probably buggy (although I
can claim at least to not be aware of any bugs at the moment).  It is
working well enough to make a pre-release worthwhile, as I am about to
turn my attention to other parts of the project.
<p>
There is some minimal <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/doc.html">documentation</a> available
for browsing, along with some annotated <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/sample.nas">sample
code</a> so you can examine the syntax.  Source code is available
under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">
LGPL</a>, and is <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/nasal-0.2.2.tar.gz">downloadable here.</a>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h3>23 Sep 2003</h3>

Another <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/nasal-0.2.2.tar.gz">release</a> is available for
public consumption.  This fixes several bugs, including crashing
issues with the garbage collector and bytecode interpreter.

<p>Also note that the name has been officially (if unimaginatively)
changed from "Nasl" to "Nasal" to avoid collision with the nice folks
at Nessus.  I'm still open to better names.  I picked this one because
it allowed me to avoid changing the pronunciation or naXXX C symbol
prefix.

</p><h3>18 Feb 2003</h3>
It has been brought to my attention that I have stepped on someone
else's name.  The <a href="http://www.nessus.org/">Nessus Project</a>
has already christened their extension language "NASL".  Oops.
Unfortunately, I currently lack the time or creativity to come up with
something better.  This will stay "Nasl" for now (different
capitalization, different acronymoid), but I promise to come up with
something less ambiguous before the next major release, if there is
one.  Suggestions are welcome.
<p>
There is a new <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/nasl-0.2.1.tar.gz">package file</a>, with some
garbage collection performance/determinism improvements and two new
sample scripts to test/benchmark <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/gcperf.nas">garbage
collection overhead</a> and <a href="http://www.plausible.org/nasal/objperf.nas">object access
speed</a>.  Both are acceptable and within design goals: GC is about
twice as fast as perl, object access about twice as slow.
