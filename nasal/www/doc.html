<h1>Nasal: Not another scripting language!</h1>

<h2>Executive summary:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)
 <li>"Normal" OOP syntax
 <li>Small!  105k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible
 <li>Functional programming
 <li>Garbage collection
</ul>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

Performance is not a design goal.  Nasal isn't especially slow.  Early
benchmarks of the garbage collector showed it as faster than perl's
reference counter, and its number crunching performance is on par with
python.  But in all cases, simplicity, transparency and a sane feature
set are preferred over speed.
<p>
World domination is not a design goal.  Nasal is designed for use as an
extension language in an larger project.  The problem with many
otherwise excellent languages in this environment is that they are
huge.  Perl and python are great, but enormous.  Even their "core"
interpreters and library code are larger than most projects that
require an embedded language.  They cannot be readily shipped with
their host application and need to be installed system-wide.  This is
a pain and a compatibility hassle.
<p>
Conversely, neither is minimalism a design goal.  The chief problem
with "small" scripting languages (scheme, lua, tcl) is that they tend
to support only a minimal set of features that the author found
useful.  While these languages are provably sufficient to support
their intended usage, they make for tedious and unproductive
development environments.  Except for the select few to whom they
appeal, these languages aren't "fun."
<p>
The real goal with Nasal is to have a language that supports most
"normal" programming idioms (objects, functions, arrays, hashes) while
avoiding the bloat that comes from "platform" scripting languages like
perl, python, ruby and php.

<h2>Notable Characteristics</h2>
Like perl, python and javascript, nasal uses vectors (expandable
arrays) and hash tables as its native data format.  This is a
well-understood idiom, and it works very well.  I felt no need to rock
the boat here.
<p>
Like perl, and unlike everything else, nasal combines numbers and
strings into a single "scalar" datatype.  No conversion needs to
happen in user code, which simplifies common string handling tasks.
<p>
Like perl, but unlike python, hash keys must by scalars in nasal.
Python supports a "tuple" constant type that can be used as well, but
there is no equivalent in nasal (you can't use vectors as keys because
they might change after the insertion).
<p>
Like perl and python, nasal uses a # character to indicate and
end-of-line comment.  There is no multiline begin/end comment syntax
as in Javascript.
<p>
Like perl, nasal functions need not have named parameters (although
named arguments are supported as a syntactic convenience).  They get
their arguments in a vector named "arg", and can extract them however
they like.  This allows the function to implement variant calling
conventions (e.g. "overloading") on its own terms.  Unlike perl, Nasal
takes advantage of this feature to do away with function "declaration"
entirly; see below.
<p>
Like python, there is no hidden local object scope in a function call.
The object on which a method was called is available to a function as
a local variable named "me" (python calls this "self" by convention,
but in nasal it is fixed -- there is no opportunity to change it).
<p>
Like perl, "objects" in nasal are simply hash tables.  Looking an item
up by name in a hash table and extracting a symbol for an object are
just different syntax for the same operation (but read on for an
important exception):
<p>
   <code> a["b"] = 1 </code> means the same thing as: <code> a.b = 1 </code>
<p>
The above paragraph is a minor lie.  The "dot" syntax is also the clue
to the interpreter to "save" the left hand side as the "me" reference
if the expression is used as a function/method call.  That is, these
expressions are <b>not</b> equivalent (one is a plain function call, the
other a method invocation on the object "a"):
<p>
     <code> a["b"](arg1, arg2) </code> isn't the same as:
     <code> a.b(arg1, arg2) </code>
<p>
Like javascript, nasal lacks a specific "class" syntax for OOP
programming.  Instead, classes are simply objects.  Each object
supports a "parents" member array; symbol lookup on the object at
runtime bounces to the parents (and the parents' parents) if the
symbol is not found in the hash.  The parents field is just like any
other object field, you can set it however you like and even change it
at runtime if you are feeling especially perverse.
<p>
Like lisp, javascript and perl, nasal supports lexical closures.  This
means that the local symbol namespace available to your function when
it is assigned remain constant over time.  If you don't know what this
means, you don't need to care.  It is this feature that allows
functions to use variables declared in the outer scope when it is
defined (e.g. seeing "module" variables).
<p>
Like all other scripting languages, functions are just symbols in a
namespace, but unlike all other scripting languages, there is no
function "declaration" syntax.  A function is always an anonymous
object (a "lambda," in the parlance), which you assign to a variable in
order to use.  Like so:
<p>
<pre>
myfunction = func(x) { x + 1 }
myfunction(1); # returns 2
</pre>
<p>
One annoyance of this feature is that Nasal functions don't have
unique internal "names".  So a debugging or exception stack trace can
only give you a source file and line number, and not a function name
as reference.
<p>
Nasal has a straightforward, readable syntax which is closest to
javascript among other scripting languages.  Like later versions of
javascript, it includes has a hash lookup syntax as well as an object
field accessor syntax (that is, you can do both <code>a.b</code> and
<code>a["b"]</code>).
<p>
Unlike python, nasal has a grammar which is not whitespace-sensitive.
This doesn't make python hard to write, and it arguably makes it
easier to read.  But it is different from the way the rest of the
world works, and makes python distinctly unsuitable for "inline"
environments (consider PHP, Javascript, ASP or in-configuration-file
scripts) where it needs to live as a plain old string inside of
another program's code or data file.
<p>
Nasal garbage collects runtime storage, so the programmer need not
worry about manual allocation, or even circular references.  The
current implementation is a simple mark/sweep collector, which should
be acceptable for most applications.  Future enhancements will include
a "return early" capability for latency-critical applications.  The
collector can be instructred to return after a certain maximum delay,
and be restarted later.  Fancy items like generational collectors fail
the "small and simple" criteria and are not likely to be included.
<p>
Like python, nasal supports exception handling as a first-class
language feature, with built-in runtime-inspectable stack trace.
Rather like perl, however, there is no special "try" syntax for
exception handling, nor inheritance-based catching semantics.
Instead, you use the <code>call()</code> builtin to invoke a function
object and inspect the results to determine what error was thrown
(either with the <code>die()</code> builtin or via an internal runtime
error) and what the stack trace looked like.  Elaborate exception
handling isn't really appropriate for embedded scripting languages.
<p>
Nasal tries to be stricter than perl.  Operations like converting a
non-numeric string value to a number, reading or writing past the end
of an array or operating on a nil reference, which are generally legal
in perl, throw exceptions in nasal.  Perl sometimes bends over
backwards to do something "reasonable" with your instructions
(e.g. what's the boolean truth value of a hash reference?); nasal
doesn't try ("error: non-scalar used in boolean context at line 92")
<p>
Nasal's interpreter is small, comparatively simple, written in ANSI C,
and generally an excellent choice for embedded applications.  It uses
a simple and transparent syntax interpretable by a simple "bracket
matching and operator precedence" parser.  It does not depend on any
third party libraries other than the standard C library.  It does not
depend on third party tools like (f)lex and yacc/bison.  It builds
simply and easily, supports a reasonably simple extension API and
cohabitates well with other code.
<p>
Nasal makes no use of the processor stack when running recursive code.
This is important for embedded languages as it provides the ability to
"exit early" from a Nasal context.  An outside application may have
realtime constraints, and Nasal can be instructed to run for only a
certain number of "cycles" before returning.  Later calls will
automatically pick up the interpreter state where it left off.
<p>
Nasal provides "minimal threadsafety", meaning that the interpreter
itself can be safely called from multiple CPU threads without risk of
corrupting or deadlocking the interpreter internals.  Multithreaded
operations are therefore "safe", although they are not guaranteed to
be atomic.  In particular, poorly synchronized insertions into
containers can "drop" objects into oblivion (which is OK from an
interpreter stability standpoint, since the GC will clean them up
normally).  Race conditions have to be the programmer's problem
anyway, this is just another symptom.  Using Nasal in a real threading
context will require locking primitives supplied by the application.
Garbage collection will, however, lock all access to the interpreter
before running.
