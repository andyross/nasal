<h1>Nasal: Not another scripting language!</h1>

<h2>Executive summary:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)
 <li>"Normal" OOP syntax
 <li>Small!  105k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible
 <li>Functional programming
 <li>Garbage collection
</ul>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

Performance is not a design goal.  Nasal isn't especially slow.  Early
benchmarks of the garbage collector showed it as faster than perl's
reference counter, and its number crunching performance is on par with
python.  But in all cases, simplicity, transparency and a sane feature
set are preferred over speed.
<p>
World domination is not a design goal.  Nasal is designed for use as an
extension language in an larger project.  The problem with many
otherwise excellent languages in this environment is that they are
huge.  Perl and python are great, but enormous.  Even their "core"
interpreters and library code are larger than most projects that
require an embedded language.  They cannot be readily shipped with
their host application and need to be installed system-wide.  This is
a pain and a compatibility hassle.
<p>
Conversely, neither is minimalism a design goal.  The chief problem
with "small" scripting languages (scheme, lua, tcl) is that they tend
to support only a minimal set of features that the author found
useful.  While these languages are provably sufficient to support
their intended usage, they make for tedious and unproductive
development environments.  Except for the select few to whom they
appeal, these languages aren't "fun."
<p>
The real goal with Nasal is to have a language that supports most
"normal" programming idioms (objects, functions, arrays, hashes) while
avoiding the bloat that comes from "platform" scripting languages like
perl, python and php.
<h2>Notable Characteristics</h2>
Like perl, python and javascript, nasal uses vectors (expandable
arrays) and hash tables as its native data format.  This is a
well-understood idiom, and it works very well.  I felt no need to rock
the boat here.
<p>
Like perl, and unlike everything else, nasal combines numbers and
strings into a single "scalar" datatype.  No conversion needs to
happen in user code, which simplifies common string handling tasks.
<p>
Like perl, but unlike python, hash keys must by scalars in nasal.
Python supports a "tuple" constant type that can be used as well, but
there is no equivalent in nasal (you can't use vectors as keys because
they might change after the insertion).
<p>
Like perl and python, nasal uses a # character to indicate and
end-of-line comment.  There is no multiline begin/end comment syntax
as in Javascript.
<p>
Like perl, nasal functions do not have named parameters.  They get
their arguments in a vector named "arg", and can extract them however
they like.  Unlike perl, Nasal takes advantage of this feature to do
away with function "declaration" entirly; see below.
<p>
Like python, there is no hidden local object scope in a function call.
The object on which a method was called is available to a function as
a local variable named "me" (python calls this "self" by convention,
but because nasal has no declared function arguments, there is no
opportunity to change it).
<p>
Like perl, "objects" in nasal are simply hash tables.  Looking an item
up by name in a hash table and extracting a symbol for an object are
just different syntax for the same operation (but read on for an
important exception):
<p>
   <code> a["b"] = 1 </code> means the same thing as: <code> a.b = 1 </code>
<p>
The above paragraph is a minor lie.  The "dot" syntax is also the clue
to the interpreter to "save" the left hand side as the "me" reference
if the expression is used as a function/method call.  That is, these
expressions are <b>not</b> equivalent (one is a plain function call, the
other a method invocation on the object "a"):
<p>
     <code> a["b"](arg1, arg2) </code> isn't the same as:
     <code> a.b(arg1, arg2) </code>
<p>
Like javascript, nasal lacks a specific "class" syntax for OOP
programming.  Instead, classes are simply objects.  Each object
supports a "parents" member array; symbol lookup on the object at
runtime bounces to the parents (and the parents' parents) if the
symbol is not found in the hash.  The parents field is just like any
other object field, you can set it however you like and even change it
at runtime if you are feeling especially perverse.
<p>
Like lisp, javascript and perl, nasal supports lexical closures.  This
means that the local symbol namespace available to your function when
it is assigned remain constant over time.  If you don't know what this
means, you don't need to care.  It is this feature that allows
functions to use variables declared in the outer scope when it is
defined (e.g. seeing "module" variables).
<p>
Like all other scripting languages, functions are just symbols in a
namespace, but unlike all other scripting languages, there is no
function "declaration" syntax.  A function is always an anonymous
object (a "lambda," in the parlance), which you assign to a variable in
order to use.  Like so:
<p>
<pre>
myfunction = func { arg[0] + 1 }
myfunction(1); # returns 2
</pre>
<p>
One annoyance of this feature is that Nasal functions don't have
unique internal "names".  So a debugging or exception stack trace can
only give you a source line number, and not a function name as
reference.
<p>
Nasal has a straightforward, readable syntax which is closest to
javascript among other scripting languages.  Like later versions of
javascript, it includes has a hash lookup syntax as well as an object
field accessor syntax (that is, you can do both <code>a.b</code> and
<code>a["b"]</code>).
<p>
Unlike python, nasal has a grammar which is not whitespace-sensitive.
This doesn't make python hard to write, and it arguably makes it
easier to read.  But it is different from the way the rest of the
world works, and makes python distinctly unsuitable for "inline"
environments (consider PHP, Javascript, ASP or in-configuration-file
scripts) where it needs to live as a plain old string inside of
another program's code or data file.
<p>
Nasal garbage collects runtime storage, so the programmer need not
worry about manual allocation, or even circular references.  The
current implementation is a simple mark/sweep collector, which should
be acceptable for most applications.  Future enhancements will include
a "return early" capability for latency-critical applications.  The
collector can be instructred to return after a certain maximum delay,
and be restarted later.  Fancy items like generational collectors fail
the "small and simple" criteria and are not likely to be included.
<p>
Like python, nasal supports exception handling as a first-class
language feature, with built-in runtime-inspectable stack trace.
Rather like perl, however, there is no special "try" syntax for
exception handling, nor inheritance-based catching semantics.
Instead, you call a "try" function on another function, and inspect
the return value on your own.  Code simply calls die with an argument
list, which is returned from the closest enclosing try() invocation.
Elaborate exception handling isn't really appropriate for embedded
scripting languages.  [NOTE: this isn't finished yet]
<p>
Nasal tries to be stricter than perl.  Operations like converting a
non-numeric string value to a number, reading or writing past the end
of an array or operating on a nil reference, which are generally legal
in perl, throw exceptions in nasal.  Perl sometimes bends over
backwards to do something "reasonable" with your instructions
(e.g. what's the boolean truth value of a hash reference?); nasal
doesn't try ("error: non-scalar used in boolean context at line 92")
<p>
Nasal is very small, very simple, written in ANSI C, and generally an
excellent choice for embedded applications.  It uses a simple and
transparent syntax interpretable by a simple "bracket matching and
operator precedence" parser.  It does not depend on any third party
libraries other than the standard C library.  It does not depend on
third party tools like (f)lex and yacc/bison.  It builds simply and
easily, supports a reasonably simple extension API and cohabitates
well with other code.
<p>
Nasal makes no use of the processor stack when running recursive code.
This is important for embedded languages as it provides the ability to
"exit early" from a Nasal context.  An outside application may have
realtime constraints, and Nasal can be instructed to run for only a
certain number of "cycles" before returning.  Later calls will
automatically pick up the interpreter state where it left off.
<p>
Nasal provides "minimal threadsafety".  Multithreaded operations on
Nasal objects are safe in the sense that they cannot crash or corrupt
the interpreter.  They are not guaranteed to be atomic.  In
particular, poorly synchronized insertions into containers can "drop"
objects into oblivion (which is OK from an interpreter stability
standpoint, since the GC will clean them up normally).  Race
conditions have to be the programmer's problem anyway, this is just
another symptom.  Garbage collection will block all threads before
running. [NOTE: this part is still unimplemented.]

<h2>Core library:</h2>

<dl>
<dt>append()
<dd>The first argument specifies a vector.  Appends the remaining
    arguments to the end of the vector.

<dt>setsize()
<dd>Sets the size of a vector. The first argument specifies a vector,
    the second a number representing the desired size of that vector.
    If the vector is currently larger than the specified size, it is
    truncated.  If it is smaller, it is padded with nil entries.
    Returns the vector operated upon.

<dt>subvec()
<dd>Returns a sub-range of a vector.  The first argument specifies a
    vector, the second a starting index, and the optional third
    argument indicates a length (the default is to the end of the
    vector).

<dt>contains()
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar.  Returns 1 if the hash contains the scalar as a key, 0
    if not.

<dt>delete()
<dd>The first argument specifies a hash, the second must be a
    scalar key.  Deletes the key from the hash if it exists.
    Operationally, this is identical to setting the hash value specified
    by the key to nil, but this variant potentially frees
    storage by deleting the reference to the key and by shrinking
    the hash.

<dt>int()
<dd>Returns the integer part of the numeric value of the single
    argument, or nil if none exists.

<dt>keys()
<dd>Returns a vector containing the list of keys found in the single
    hash argument.

<dt>num()
<dd>Returns the numeric value of the single argument, or nil if none
    exists.

<dt>pop()
<dd>Removes and returns the last element of the single vector argument.

<dt>size()
<dd>Returns the size of the single argument.  For strings, this is
    the length in bytes.  For vectors, this is the number of
    elements.  For hashes, it is the number of key/value pairs.  Returns
    nil for number and nil arguments.

<dt>streq() <dd>Tests the string values of the two arguments for
equality.  Needed because the == operator in Nasal tests for numeric
equality, as in perl.  So <code>"0"&nbsp;==&nbsp"0.0"</code> is
true, but <code>streq("0",&nbsp;"0.0")</code> is false.  This is
rarely required in typical code.

<dt>substr()
<dd>Computes a substring.  The first argument specifes a string, the
    second is an integer index of the start of a substring, the
    optional third argument specifies a length (the default is to
    return the remaining string).  Example: substr("abcde", 1, 3)
    returns "bcd".

<dt>typeof()
<dd>Returns a string indicating the type of the single argument, any
    of: nil, scalar, vector, hash, func, or ghost.

<dt>call()
<dd>Calls a function.  The first argument must be a function object.
    The second is a vector of arguments.  The optional third argument
    specified an OOP object on which to call the function.  This
    method allows you to compute argument lists and object
    indirections at runtime.

<dt>eval()
<dd>Parses and executes Nasal code stored in a single string argument.
    Returns the result of the Nasal script found in the string.  The
    code is executed in the lexical environment of the calling
    function, just as if it had been defined in a <code>func { ...
    }</code> block.

<dt>math.sin()
<dd>Returns the sine of the single argument

<dt>math.cos()
<dd>Returns the cosine of the single argument

<dt>math.exp()
<dd>Returns <i>e</i> (Euler's constant) raised to the power
    specified by the single argument

<dt>math.ln()
<dd>Returns the natural logarithm of the single argument.

<dt>math.sqrt()
<dd>Returns the square root of the single argument.

<dt>math.atan2(x, y)
<dd>Returns the arctangent of y/x, with the correct sign for the
    quadrant.  Wraps the ANSI C function of the same name.
