Nasal SWIG:

This is a SWIG wrapper for Nasal written by Manabu Nishiyama.  SWIG
(http://www.swig.org) is an "interface compiler" that automatically
produces script engine wrappers for C and C++ libraries.

See the documentation in doc/index.html for how to apply these changes
to a SWIG source tree.
