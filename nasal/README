There is no Makefile.  I build stuff on my home projects using a
custom dependency/build tool ("plm", which I might get into shape to
release some day -- bug me if you care).  Just compile all the C
source together into a binary.  Link in the math library if your
platform doesn't by default.  On most linux distributions, this is
sufficient:

     gcc -O2 -o nasl *.c -lm

The optimizer flag is vaguely important.  Nasl's bytecode interpreter
makes use of many tiny functions, and benefits greatly from the gcc
inliner; I've seen tight bytecode loops ("number crunching") run 20
times faster when using the optimizer.

Documentation, such as it is (it is currently more akin to design
notes than docs) is in doc.html.  Some sample code with annotation is
in sample.nas.

Important source to read is prog-nasl.c, lib.c and nasl.h.  These
define and implement the user-side extension API.

Portability notes: the sample main() routine (not really part of nasl,
per se) expects a Unix-style stat() syscall to get file sizes.  It
should hopefully compile under Cygwin, but Windows users may need to
do some porting work if they want to use the command line interpreter.

More deeply, there is a byte order dependency in nasl.h -- the naRef
structure needs to be modified for big endian systems by swapping the
"ref" and "ptr" fields.  Without this, nasl will compile and run just
fine, but end users will be able to crash the interpreter (or worse)
by introducing a carefully crafted numeric value that will be
interpreted as an object.
