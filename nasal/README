Important source to read is nasal.h, nasal-bin.c, and lib.c.  These
define and implement the user-side extension API.

Don't use the -ansi switch to gcc.  It turns off preprocessor
recognition of the "// ..." commenting style, which Nasal uses
pervasively and is supported by all modern C compilers.  Note that
-ansi doesn't generate better code, nor find any extra warning
conditions.  Pedants can take refuge in the fact that Nasal is
compliant with the emerging ANSI C99 standard.
