{"name":"Nasal","body":"### Nasal: Not another scripting language!\r\n\r\n* Vectors, Hashes and Scalars (number/strings)\r\n* \"Normal\" OOP syntax\r\n* Small! 146k source code. Easily embeddable and extensible\r\n* Functional programming\r\n* Garbage collected\r\n* Threadsafe\r\n\r\nNasal is a language that I wrote for use in a personal\r\nproject. Ostensibly it was because I was frustrated with the dearth of\r\nsmall-but-complete embeddable scripting languages, but of course I\r\nreally wrote it because it was fun. It is still young and incomplete\r\nin a few places, but is under active development and has been\r\nintegrated as the extension language for the FlightGear simulator.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is still sparse. There is a design document available,\r\nwhich talks at length about the \"why's\" behind the design of Nasal and\r\nincludes documentation for the built-in library functions. More useful\r\nto the experienced programmer is the tutorial-style sample code, which\r\nexplains and demonstrates all the syntax features of the language.\r\n\r\nSource code is available under the terms of the GNU LGPL:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/andyross/nasal\r\n\r\nQuestions and comments can go to the author, Andy Ross, via email at\r\nandy@plausible.org.\r\n","tagline":"Nasal scripting language","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
